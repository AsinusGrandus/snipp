# snipp - a simple snippingtool
Windows 11 broke its snipping tool, so I made this to (temporarily) replace it.

# how to use
Let's say you want to take a screenshot from a specific area:

- hover with your mouse over the left upper corner and press left ctrl
- hover with your mouse over the right bottom corner and press left alt
- save the selected area by pressing tab

It will save the screenshot on the location from the snipp file, and to your clipboard.
