# snipp - a simple snippingtool
Windows 11 broke it's snipping tool, so I made this to (temporarily) replace it.

# how to use
The left upper corner from the area you want to screenshot can be marked with left crtl, 
to mark the right bottom corner from the area you can use left alt. To save the screenshot, you can use tab. 

It will save the screenshot on the location from the snipp file, and to your clipboard.
